# Level-2-Project

Program: TextDisplay
Creator: Tyler Reinecke

Description: This program displays words at a user defined speed (Words/Minute) in the center of a window. You can 
             either paste the desired text into a JTextArea, or the user can upload a text document to display. 
             To run the program, click 
<a href="https://github.com/rylr/Level-2-Project/blob/master/TextDisplay/TextDisplay.jar?raw=true">here</a>

Instructions: After running the program, the user can choose to either upload text from a document, or to input the
              the text manually. If the user chooses to upload from a file, a window will appear and they only need
              to input their desired speed to display the words. If the user chooses to input the text manually,
              the same window will appear, and they will have to input their desired speed and the text itself.
